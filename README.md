## image_Classifier.ipynb 
: Created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and use it to classify handwritten digits.

## Visualisation_and_plotting.ipynb
: Learn how to view misclassified samples, which will help  understand that CNNs are not infallible and give  some intuition into how they work.

: learn to display the feature maps that are output by various convolution and pooling layers in a network, given certain input into  trained CNN.


## Transfer_learning_and_visualisation.ipynb
: Use Transfer Learning to improve accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset. The purpose is to get experience using pretrained models.


## filter_max,class_max_and_grad_max.ipynb

: Visualize filter maximizations of a pretrained CNN. The purpose is to get experience in performing gradient ascent and using Kerasâ€™s backend functions.
